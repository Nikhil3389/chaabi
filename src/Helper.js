      "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. This quote by the great leader, Nelson Mandela, reminds us that failure is a part of life and it is not something to be ashamed of. It is how we respond to failure that determines our character. Whether we choose to give up or get back up and keep going, defines who we are. Success is not just about achieving our goals, it is also about overcoming obstacles and learning from our mistakes. In the end, what matters most is not the number of times we fall, but the number of times we rise.",

    quote:
      "All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know. As a writer, Ernest Hemingway knew the importance of being authentic and truthful in his writing. This quote encourages writers to focus on expressing their personal truths and experiences, rather than trying to conform to what they think others want to hear. Writing can be a powerful way to connect with others and share our perspectives on the world. By writing from a place of authenticity, we can create work that resonates with readers on a deeper level.",

    quote:
      "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.This proverb recognizes the importance of community and collaboration. While individual accomplishments can be impressive, it is often through working with others that we can achieve long-lasting and meaningful change. Building strong relationships and working towards a shared vision can help us overcome challenges and accomplish more than we could on our own. In a world that often emphasizes individualism, this quote is a reminder of the value of teamwork and building connections with others.",

    quote:
      "Owning our story can be hard but not nearly as difficult as spending our lives running from it. Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love and belonging and joyâ€”the experiences that make us the most vulnerable. Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light.",

  {
    quote:
      "Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. I am going to have kind thoughts towards others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others. I am going to benefit others as much as I can.",
